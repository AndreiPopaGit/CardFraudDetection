# Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a growing concern in the digital age, where online transactions have become the norm. This project aims to address the challenge of identifying fraudulent transactions by leveraging machine learning techniques. By analyzing patterns in transactional data, this solution can help businesses and individuals prevent financial losses due to fraud.

## Project Description

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced data analysis and machine learning algorithms. The process involves cleaning and preprocessing data, exploring feature relationships, building predictive models, and evaluating their performance to ensure accurate and reliable fraud detection.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Imported and cleaned the dataset to prepare for analysis.
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and normalized the data.
   - Addressed class imbalance using oversampling and other techniques.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized patterns in fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.
   - Identified key features and relationships using statistical methods.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Selected and engineered features to enhance model accuracy.

4. **Model Building and Training:**
   - Tested multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
   - Selected the best-performing model for deployment.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Developed a Python script (`test.py`) for model testing and real-time predictions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
